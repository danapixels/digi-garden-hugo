## Lessons learned in 2025


### It's okay to work

At the end of the day, your life is for you to have purpose. I think I struggle sometimes with the fact that I love to do "work" whether it be writing, my day job, or doing something creative on the side. At least for right now in my life, I accept myself as I am.

### Familial guilt

As someone who is not a part of a "normal" immediate family, as I've gotten older, I've forgiven myself and my family. I don't go see my family, have holiday dinners with them, etc. I call my mom maybe once every two months. It used to really bug me five years ago but now I feel like the way my family is now is the best way I can show love and I realized it's how they show love.

### Create without comparison

My friend is an amazing writer and I am nothing like him. It unconsciously made me stop posting on my blog because I wanted to write better. The point of my blog was to freely put random shit. It's easy for me to get caught up in trying to perfect something.

### It's okay to be a hater

I used to feel guilty about feeling strongly about my stances. I wasn't subtle when I was younger and I felt like I needed to make myself smaller to conform. Now, I feel like there isn't ENOUGH haters and too many fence sitters. Life isn't always black and white but your opinions can be.
